# There Are Actually Four Tracks

Haha, I tricked you (maybe?).

Those playback controls are actually controlling four separate audio tracks, each one a single voice part (Tenor, Lead, Baritone, Base) of a Barbershop Quartet.

This branch isn't all that much different from `audio-01` ... it just displays the controls for the individual parts.
