# Some Animation

Using the `AnalyserNode` from `audio-04b` and the `PannerNode` from `audio-05`, I've added some extra markup and CSS to make some singers (in the style of South Park Canadians).

I picked an interesting frequency from the `AnalyzerNode` and used that to programmatically drive the properties of the `Dragger.ts` characters.
