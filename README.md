# Basics : Play/Pause, Volume, Time

Running this project displays an interface with a:

* Seek slider - which displays and adjusts playback position 
* Volume slider - which displays and adjusts audio volume
* Play/Pause button - which starts/stops playback

Most of the interesting things are in `index.html` and `main.ts` (extensive comments and links to documentation here!).

Though, there is also some flexbox fun in `styles.css`.
